[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

---

## Problem Statement
The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?T

#### Steps to solve the problem
[1)  Import required libraries and packages](#section-a)  
[2)  Generate Random Numbers](#section-b)  
[3)  Generate PMF Plot](#section-c)  
[4)  Generate CDF Plot](#section-d)

## <a name="section-a"></a> 1. Imports

```{python}
import numpy as np
import nsfg
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
```
---

## <a name="section-b"></a> 2. Random Numbers
```{python}
random_numbers = np.random.random(1000)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(random_numbers, label='random numbers')
```

---

## <a name="section-c"></a> 3. PMF Plot
```{python}
thinkplot.PrePlot()
thinkplot.Pmfs([pmf], linewidth=0.05)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='probability', ylabel='PMF')
'''
  Can't determine if distribution is meaningful. PMF works well if number of values is small. The number of values is large, 
  as a result the probability associated with each values is small. We can't ascertain from the data the probability of each value. 
'''

## <a name="section-d"></a> 4.CDF Plot
```{python}
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random_numbers, label='random_numbers')
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Percentile Rank', ylabel='CDF')
'''
  The distribution appears to be linearly uniform. For example 50% of the sample is below the 50th percentile.
